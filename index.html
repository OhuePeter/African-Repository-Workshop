        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the Co-creation African Repository WorkshopÂ is to bring together specialists from the community to jointly investigate the best ways to develop a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) solution for a knowledge repository. This collection seeks to be easily available, contextualized, and localized in order to be a useful tool for educating Africans about the foundations, importance, and real-world applications of human-computer interaction (HCI) on their continent. The workshop aims to explore fundamental concepts such as <b>accessibility, usability, and user-centered</b> design principles in addition to other forms of interaction.</p>
        <p>The platform additionally aims to tackle community-specific issues such content authenticity and trust, content dating, relevance, interpretation, and content evolution over time. Important things to think about will be how to tailor material to specific audiences and make sure that information is presented in a way that makes sense to a range of users. The workshop will also look at a user-centric strategy that emphasizes a "pull" mechanism in which users actively seek out knowledge and information instead of using a traditional "push" strategy that involves inundating users with material.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the goal of the workshop is to encourage professionals to work together and co-create in order to create a community-driven knowledge base that is inclusive and aims to address specific difficulties that are specific to the African setting while also imparting insights into HCI.</p>
